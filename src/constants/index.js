export const HERO_CONTENT = `I have 3 years of experience in software development. I am a fast learner, have high problem solving skills and are prone to teamwork. In the projects I am involved in, I not only write code, but also think in detail about how the product we produce will respond to the end user and aim to contribute to my team with a solution-oriented approach. In addition to constantly improving my technical knowledge, I aim to become a talented team leader by increasing my communication and collaboration skills. I am someone who follows technology closely and does not neglect to integrate new trends into my own projects.`;

export const EDUCATION = `I studied computer engineering at Fenerbah√ße University with a full scholarship. I grasped the basics of programming and the deep philosophy of algorithms. "How to write good code?" instead of "How can I be a good engineer?" I learned the answer to the question. I managed the university's software club for 2 years. Together with my team, we planned the organization of various software events and projects.`;

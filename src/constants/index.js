export const ABOUT_ME = `I have 3 years of experience in software development and during this time, I have actively participated in many different projects and expanded my technical knowledge. Thanks to my fast learning ability and strong problem-solving skills, I can produce effective solutions to complex software problems. I understand the importance of being a part of a team and with my inclination to teamwork, I exhibit a constructive and supportive approach to achieve common goals.

In projects, beyond just writing code, I evaluate the user experience, performance and interaction model of the developed product in detail. I contribute to my team with a solution-oriented mindset by considering user needs. While constantly updating my technical competencies, I also keep my goal of becoming a talented and effective team leader alive in the future by improving my communication and collaboration skills.

I do not hesitate to integrate innovative approaches into my projects by closely following current technology trends. In this way, I not only apply existing technical solutions, but also incorporate innovative ideas into my projects to create more comprehensive and user-friendly products. Thanks to my analytical thinking ability and curiosity, I see every new challenge I encounter as an opportunity for development.`;

export const EDUCATION = `I studied computer engineering at Fenerbah√ße University with a full scholarship. I grasped the basics of programming and the deep philosophy of algorithms. "How to write good code?" instead of "How can I be a good engineer?" I learned the answer to the question. I managed the university's software club for 2 years. Together with my team, we planned the organization of various software events and projects.`;

export const EDUCATION_CS50 = `I successfully completed the CS50 course organized by Harvard University.
